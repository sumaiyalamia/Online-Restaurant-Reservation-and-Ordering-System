# Online-Restaurant-Reservation-and-Ordering-System
The languages used for this project are PHP, Javascript and MySQL. The project has two panels: user and admin.
# User Panel: From the user panel, an individual can order food as well as reserve a table by filling out an online form. Table reservations can be done by filtering time, date, and number of people.
# Admin Panel: An admin can check the total number of orders and table reservations, accept and reject the bookings, and search a particular booking using a booking ID.
